# üîé Recap: Where to find...

- ...the **spec draft**? [tc39.es/proposal-temporal](https://tc39.es/proposal-temporal/)
- ...the MDN-style **API docs**? [tc39.es/proposal-temporal/docs](https://tc39.es/proposal-temporal/docs/)
- ...the **cookbook**? [tc39.es/proposal-temporal/docs/cookbook.html](https://tc39.es/proposal-temporal/docs/cookbook.html)
- ...the **polyfill**? [tc39/proposal-temporal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal/tree/main/polyfill) on GitHub
- ...a quick **JS environment with Temporal**?
  - _open your browser console on the API docs page_

---

# üÜï What's new since last time?

- [Cookbook](https://tc39.es/proposal-temporal/docs/cookbook.html) complete
- Calendar
- Custom time zones
- TypeScript types

---

## üìÜ Calendar

Needed e.g. when doing calculations in another calendar system

Works transparently with the existing API

```javascript
date.withCalendar('...').plus({ months: 1 })
  // adds the number of days in that month according to the calendar
```

---

## üåê Custom time zones

Needed e.g. when recreating particular versions of tzdata in secure environments

```javascript
class MyTimeZone extends Temporal.TimeZone {
  constructor() { super('Some_Identifier'); }
  getOffsetNanosecondsFor(absolute) { ... }
  getPossibleAbsolutesFor(dateTime) { ... }
  *getTransitions(absolute) { ... }
}
```

## ‚å® TypeScript types

Useful for people trying out the polyfill

![](typescript.png)

---

# üõ£ Roadmap

- **This week,** release and publicize polyfill
- **In a few months,** request Stage 3 advancement

---

# üõ£ Roadmap

Between this week and Stage 3:
- [List of issues to address](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal/milestone/1)
- Inform decisions with feedback from polyfill users
- Release an updated polyfill with API improvements based on feedback
- W3C TAG review
- Finalize specification

---

# üîú Polyfill release

- "Does it block releasing a version of the polyfill?"
  - Yes? ‚Äî Address it now
  - No? ‚Äî Make a provisional decision for now, and revisit before Stage 3 based on feedback

---

# üì¢ Feedback

- Feedback on the API from the JS developer community
- What we have gotten so far has proved valuable
- Community members participating in champions group calls!

---

# ‚ùì Things the plenary should be aware of

- Binary comparison operators
- Default calendar

---

## Binary comparison operators

How to correctly compare two dates:

```javascript
date1.equals(date2)  // ‚áí true or false
Temporal.Date.compare(date1, date2)  // ‚áí -1, 0, or 1
```

How people will probably try to compare two dates:

```javascript
date1 === date2
date1 >= date2
```

---

## Binary comparison operators

- `===`, `!==`, `==`, `!=` will just not work that way
- Returning a value from `valueOf()` could salvage `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`
  - But would also allow meaningless comparisons with numbers and across Temporal types

---

## Binary comparison operators

Question:
- Do we make `valueOf()` **throw**, or **return a BigInt?**

Temporal Champions current answer:
- `valueOf()` **throws**
- Revisit before Stage 3 based on feedback

üí¨ **Feedback?**

## Default calendar

- Calendar API is meant to be unobtrusive in cases where it's not needed
- Most code will use the ISO 8601 calendar
  - Even in locales where a different calendar is used, can convert with `toLocaleString()`

---

## Default calendar

Potential i18n correctness bugs arise with default ISO 8601 calendar when doing calendar-sensitive calculations in locales with a different default calendar system:
```javascript
const today = Temporal.now.date();
console.log("Today is:", today.toLocaleString());
const nextMonth = today.plus({ months: 1 });
console.log("Next month is: ", nextMonth.toLocaleString());
```
> Today is: Ramadan 24, 1441 AH
> Next month is: Shawwal ~~24~~**25**, 1441 AH

---

## Default calendar

Question:
- Do we make **ISO 8601 default** or require specifying a calendar explicitly?
  - (many different options with different pros and cons, [see discussion thread](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal/issues/292))

Temporal Champions current answer:
- **Default to ISO 8601 calendar**
- Revisit before Stage 3 based on feedback
